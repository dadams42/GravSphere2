# GravSphere2
GravSphere 2 is an improved solver of the spherical higher-order Jeans equations, designed to mass-model galaxies and star clusters with minimal bias and maximizing information content. It improves on previous versions of GravSphere and other methods by removing the need for binning and performing a full general treatment of higher moments.
